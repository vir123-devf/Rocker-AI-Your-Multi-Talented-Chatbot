##  Introducing Your Chatty Companion: A Multi-Talented Chatbot with Streamlit 

This project brings you a one-stop shop for all your chatbot needs! It boasts a variety of features powered by Gemini, Google's latest large language models:

**1. Chat with a Memorable Friend:**

- Engage in conversations that flow naturally, thanks to the chatbot's ability to remember past interactions (powered by Gemini-pro).
- No more starting from scratch each time! Build a rapport and have meaningful conversations.

**2. See the World Through Text (and Images!):**

- Upload an image, and our image captioning feature (using Gemini-1.5-pro) will describe it for you. Let the chatbot be your visual interpreter!

**3. Craft Text with Finesse:**

- Feeling stuck for words? Our embed text feature can generate creative text based on your input, helping you express yourself more effectively.

**4. Ask Away, Get Answers (Even Without Remembering Everything!):**

- This simple chatbot, separate from the memory-based one, is always ready to answer your questions, powered by Ask Me Anything.

**How it Works:**

The project is neatly organized into two main sections:

- **main.py:** This file handles all the user interface aspects using the powerful Streamlit library. Streamlit makes it easy to create interactive web apps, perfect for our chatbot.
- **gemini_utility:** This section is the heart of the project, where all the generative models are loaded and functions are defined. Here's where the magic of Gemini comes to life!

**Getting Started (It's Easy!):**
